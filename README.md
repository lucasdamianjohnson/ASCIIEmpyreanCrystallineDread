#  Empyrean Crystalline Dread - ASCII Node.Js Game
Game that I am working on that runs in the command line. It is built using Node.Js and TypeScript. 
The only depedency is my own DS Commander. 

To run download and open a terminal in the root directory. Then run:

```console
node .
```

If you want to run with audio run: 

```console
node . -a
```

You will be prompeted to open to http://localhost:8080 in a web browser. 
You will have to click in the window in order for the sound to start.
